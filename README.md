# Python template for a kata

- Template repository for Python katas (Dockerized)
- The repository is created as a **GitHub repository template**, so that you can easily create your own GitHub repository from this one.
  - [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) you can find the instructions: easy peasy!
  - There is a **GH project** associated with this repo, with some pending improvements.
- Everything is **Dockerized**. If you run `make` from the root folder of the project, you can see all the actions that you can execute (e.g. running the tests, static analysis, code coverage, etc.)


## HOW to use it
1. Generate a repo using this one as a template, following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Replace the `python-kata-name` placeholder that appears in several files with your own name (e.g. `python-fizzbuzz`). 
   - For example, you can easily do it running `make rename-project new-name=python-fizzbuzz`


## Prerequisites
- You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
- **IMPORTANT**: just the first time, run `make local-setup`.
    - This will set up things like configuring Git hooks. The `pre-commit` hook will automatically run the linters and tests, rejecting the commit in case any of them fail.


## How to update or add a Python package
  1. In the terminal, run:
     - In case it's a development dependency: `make add-dev-package package=<package_name>` 
     - In case it's a "production" dependency: `make add-package package=<package_name>`
  2. Commit and push the changes updated in the file `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml`


## Functionalities included
- There is pipeline configured as a GitHub Action which runs all the linters, the tests and both the coverage and mutation testing.
  - The artifacts with the HTML reports generated can be downloaded from the GitHub project tab "Actions" --> "Summary" --> "Artifacts".
- [**Dependabot**](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file) is configured at GitHub repository level, in order to automatically update the dependencies weekly.
- A **badge** on top of this README file shows the status of the GH Action (passing or failing).
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is used as the Python packaging and dependency manager. 
- I have used [**black**](https://github.com/psf/black) for both linting and formatting.
  - If the format check fails, you can automatically format whatever missing running `make reformat`.
- I use [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as static type checker.

### Testing
  - Libraries
    - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)
    - [python-doublex](https://python-doublex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): powerful test doubles framework for Python
    - [expects](https://expects.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): an expressive and extensible TDD/BDD assertion library for Python
    - [doublex-expects](https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/doublex-expects): a matchers library for the Expects assertion library
    - [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist): it extends `pytest` with new test execution modes, the most used being distributing tests across multiple CPUs to speed up test execution
  - You can easily run the **test coverage** with `make test-coverage`
  - You can easily run **mutation testing** with `make test-run-mutation`
    - Mutmut keeps a result cache in `.mutmut-cache` so if you want to make sure you run a full mutmut run just delete this file.
